FUNCTION DEFINATION : 

🧠 ⭐ RULE: When a function is called, JavaScript must return to where it was called from.

🧠 WHY does it return?
Because JS function calls work like:
Call
Execute
Return back to caller
This is automatic — you don’t write return, JS does it internally.

When a function returns, the program MUST go back to the function that called it.
When a function ends, it returns to the place where it was called and continues the remaining lines.
When a function ends (no return inside), JavaScript automatically returns undefined and goes back to the place that called it.
Ending a function  MEANS returning BACK TO THE CALLER . 

✔ WHY DOES IT “GO BACK”?
Because every function call must finish and return control to whoever called it.
Even if it returns undefined.

Returning undefined is still a “return”.
✔ If you DO NOT use return
Function stops at the end and gives undefined.
✔ If you DO use return value
Function stops immediately and gives that value to the caller.


THE ONE RULE YOU MUST REMEMBER
👉 Whenever you call a function, JavaScript MUST return back to where the call happened.
If JavaScript does NOT return back:
your program would break
it wouldn’t be able to continue

EXAMPLE1:
function abc(a)
 {
    console.log("hello");
}

abc(2);
EXPLANATION :

You call the function
abc(2)
This means:
✔️ Call function abc
✔️ Pass value 2 into parameter a
So now inside the function:
a = 2
Function executes its code
Inside abc() the code is:
console.log("hello")
So It prints:
hello
Function ends
There is no return, so the function returns undefined automatically.

HOW TO SEE UNDEFINED IN THE CONSOLE :  there are TWO WAYS
1) CONSOLE.LOG(abc(1))
2) var c = abc(1)
console.log("c",c)

WHAT IS RETURNING :

Let’s see a simple example:
console.log("A");
hello();
console.log("C");

function hello()
 {
    console.log("B");
}

OUTPUT:
A
B
C

Why?
Because:
hello() is called
Javascript jumps inside hello()
Runs code
Comes back to the next line after hello()
This is called returning.

EXAMPLE 2 :
1 function two() 
2 {
3    console.log("Inside two");
4 }
5
6 function one() 
7 {
8    console.log("Inside one");
9    two();
10    console.log("Back to one");
11 }

one();

 OUTPUT :
 8. inside one .
 3. inside two .
 10 back to one .

EXPLNATION :
one() starts
It calls two() → goes inside
two() finishes
JavaScript returns back
Now "Back to one" prints
👉 Function calls do NOT erase the old function. They pause it, execute the new one, then return back to continue.
There is no return, so the function returns undefined automatically TO THE CALLER AND IT ENDS.
When function reaches the last line → it stops itself
✔ When you use return → it stops early
✔ When no return → JS automatically returns undefined

HOW DOES A FUNCTION ENDS 
✔ A function ends in 2 ways:
1️⃣ Naturally (no more lines to run)
→ returns undefined
2️⃣ Forcefully (using return)
→ returns what you wrote

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FUNCTION ENDS 
✅ Two important things happen when a function ends:
1️⃣ The function RETURNS a value (default = undefined)
2️⃣ The program GOES BACK to where the function was called
These two things happen at the same time.
When a function finishes:
✔ It returns a value (undefined if no return)
AND
✔ It goes back to the place that called it
These are NOT separate.
Both happen automatically.

EXAMPLE 3:

function abc() 
{
    console.log("hello")
    return "nibaa"
}

abc()
EXPLANATION :
🔹 Step 1 — JavaScript sees your function definition
It sees:
There is a function named abc
Inside that function:
Print "hello"
Then give back "nibaa"
This gives a value back (but you are not storing it anywhere).
So if you do:
console.log(abc())
You will get:
hello
nibaa
Because:
"hello" is printed by the function
"nibaa" is printed by console.log

🔥 MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT
❗ A function can do TWO things:
✔ 1. Print something
(using console.log())

✔ 2. Return something
(using return)
These two are NOT the same.

                                           RECURSIVE FUNCTION 

RECURSIVE FUNCTION DEFINATION : recursive means calling  the same function again.
👉 Function calls do NOT erase the old function. They pause it, execute the new one, then return back to continue.
⭐ Rule of Recursion (VERY IMPORTANT)
Every recursive function needs two things:
1️⃣ Base condition (stop condition)
→ Stops recursion
2️⃣ Recursive call
→ Calls the function again

✅ Program: Print "hello" 2 times using recursion
function printHello(count) 
{

    // 1. STOP when count becomes 0
    if (count === 0)
     {
        return;
    }

    // 2. Print
    console.log("hello");

    // 3. Call function again (reduce count)
    printHello(count - 1);
}

printHello(2);

✅ return
Where it is used?
➡️ Inside a function
What it does?
➡️ Stops the entire function
➡️ Sends a value back (optional)
➡️ No further code in that function will run
Keyword	   -        Stops What?
break      -	  Stops only the loop
return      -    	Stops the whole function

recursion without return :

function abc(i) {
    console.log("i", i);

    while (i <= 5) {
        i = i + 1;
        abc(i);
    }
}

abc(1);

EXPLANATION :
abc(1) starts calling the function , so 1 goes to  i 
i is 1 so 1 will be print 
check while consiton , so 1<=5 is true 





function abc(n)
 {
  console.log("start", n);
   abc(n + 1);  // calling again NO RETURN
  console.log("end", n);
}

abc(1);

output :12345678910111212131417.. function wont stop 
infinte loop .

without return recursion never stops, so the end line never runs .


recursion with return :

Returning means:
Recursion WITH return

Function stops when condition is met
Starts coming back
Line after recursive call runs
This prints values in reverse order
Safe and controlled
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
⚡ A function call PAUSES the current function.
⚡ When the called function finishes, the paused function continues from the next line.

That’s what “going back” means.
🚦 Let’s show it step-by-step with a simple diagram
Your code:

function abc(i) {
  console.log("i =", i);

  if (i >= 3) {
    return;
  }

  abc(i + 1);
  console.log("after call", i);
}

abc(1);

🔥 VISUAL EXPLANATION (THIS WILL MAKE 100% SENSE)
Imagine each function call is a page in a notebook.

➤ STEP 1: abc(1) starts
i = 1
Then it sees:
abc(2)

📌 abc(1) stops HERE and waits.
It creates a new page for abc(2).

➤ STEP 2: abc(2) starts
i = 2
Then it sees:
abc(3)

📌 abc(2) stops HERE and waits.
It creates another new page for abc(3).

➤ STEP 3: abc(3) starts
i = 3
Now:
if (i >= 3) return;

✔ abc(3) returns
✔ abc(3) page is finished

📌 Now the program returns to the previous paused page → abc(2)
⭐ THIS IS THE “GO BACK” MOMENT
📍 You paused abc(2) at:
abc(3);   // <-- paused here


When abc(3) finishes, abc(2) continues from the next line:
console.log("after call 2");
And then abc(2) finishes.

⭐ Now it “goes back” to abc(1)
Because abc(1) was paused at:
abc(2);   // paused here
Now abc(2) has finished.
So abc(1) continues:
console.log("after call 1");


Then abc(1) finishes.
🎉 THAT'S ALL
To summarize:

abc(1) calls abc(2)  → abc(1) pauses
abc(2) calls abc(3)  → abc(2) pauses
abc(3) returns       → go back to abc(2)
abc(2) returns       → go back to abc(1)
abc(1) returns       → program ends

🔥 SUPER EASY EXAMPLE (TO MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR)

Imagine this:
You are writing notes.
You stop and call your brother.
Your brother stops and calls his friend.
Friend finishes talking → comes back to your brother.
Your brother continues talking → comes back to you.
You continue your work.

This is exactly how recursion works.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

PRINT 1 TO 5 NUMBERS USING RECURSION 


function abc(i)
{
    console.log("i", i)

    while (i <= 5)
    {
        i = i + 1
        abc(i)
    }
}
abc(1)

explanation :
Start: abc(1)
i = 1 → print "i 1"
while(1 <= 5) → TRUE
  i = 2
  abc(2)

▶ Next: abc(2)
i = 2 → print "i 2"
while(2 <= 5) → TRUE
  i = 3
  abc(3)

▶ Next: abc(3)
i = 3 → print "i 3"
while(3 <= 5) → TRUE
  i = 4
  abc(4)

▶ Next: abc(4)
i = 4 → print "i 4"
while(4 <= 5) → TRUE
  i = 5
  abc(5)

⭐⭐ Now important part — abc(5) ⭐⭐
i = 5 → print "i 5"
while(5 <= 5) → TRUE
  i = 6
  abc(6)

▶ Next: abc(6)
i = 6 → print "i 6"
while(6 <= 5) → FALSE
(loop ends)
function ends

What happens after abc(6)?
