🎯 What is array[array.length] ?

👉 It is a way to add a new element at the END of an array manually.

📌 First, understand: What is array.length?

array.length means:

How many items are inside the array.

Example:

var arr = [10, 20, 30];


Here,

arr.length is 3
(because the array has 3 items)

🎯 Now understand: What is array[array.length]?

Since array.length is 3…

array[array.length] becomes:

array[3]


Look:

index:   0     1     2
value:  10    20    30


There is no element at index 3 yet.

So assigning:

arr[arr.length] = 40;


becomes:

arr[3] = 40;


Now the array becomes:

[10, 20, 30, 40]

❤️ SIMPLE EXPLANATION
array[array.length] = newValue

means

👉 Put the new value at the next empty place in the array.

⭐ Example
var colors = ["red", "green"];

colors[colors.length] = "blue";


Here:

colors.length is 2

So it does colors[2] = "blue"

Result:

["red", "green", "blue"]

🎉 Final line to remember
array.length points to the first empty position.

So:

✔ array[array.length] = x = add x to end of the array
