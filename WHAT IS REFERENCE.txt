 Copy means new separate value. Reference means two variables point to the same memory.

 Imagine This Real Example
🟢 Case 1: Number (Copy)

You write the number 10 on a paper.

You give your friend a photocopy of that paper.

Now:

You change your copy to 20.

Your friend’s copy is still 10.

Because it was a COPY.

That is how numbers and strings work.


Case 2: Object (Reference)

Now imagine:

There is only ONE whiteboard in the room.

You and your friend both look at the SAME whiteboard.

If your friend changes 10 → 50
You will also see 50.

Because it’s the SAME board.

That is how objects and arrays work.

example 1 :
 var a = 10;
var b = a;

b = 20;

console.log(a); //10

Example 2 (Object)
var a = { value: 10 };
var b = a;

b.value = 50;

console.log(a.value);


Will print:

50

var arr1 = [1,2,3];
var arr2 = arr1;

arr2[1] = 99;

console.log(arr1[1]);

Because both are looking at SAME object.

 number → copy

string → copy

object → shared

array → shared


 A reference means:

Two variables pointing to the same memory location.
They are not copies.
They share the same data.

var ar = [10, 20, 30]
var br = ar   // reference copy

br.push(40)

console.log(ar)  // [10, 20, 30, 40]
console.log(br)  // [10, 20, 30, 40]


Why did ar change?

Because:
br is NOT a new array
br is pointing to the SAME array as ar

Memory looks like this:

ar  ----\
          → [10, 20, 30, 40]
br  ----/

Both point to same object.

Reference = sharing the same memory
👉 Copy = creating new memory

   var a  =  5

var b = a 

a = 10 

console.log(a)  //10

console.log(b) // 5

// duplicate an array 23,34,54,10,4,7

  var array = [23,34,54,10,4,7]
   

   var output = array.slice()
      
   output.push(777)
   console.log(output)

   console.log(array)
