<!--functions which accept other functions as arguments those functions are called first call funtions.
call back functions: functions which are passed as an argument are called as call back fucnutions. -->


<!-- In JavaScript, functions are special â€”
they are treated just like normal values (numbers, strings, etc.)
That means you can:
Store them in variables
Pass them to other functions
Return them from other functions -->
//Store a function in a variable
