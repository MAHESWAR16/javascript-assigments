<!--functions which accept other functions as arguments those functions are called first call funtions.
call back functions: those functions which are passed as an argument are called as call back fucnutions. 
why we use call back functions 
 a) too handle the errors in the right way
 example functions ki wrong arguments ganak pass cheste ee callback find out chestayii that code we written in callback fucntion to throw the erros -->


<!-- In JavaScript, functions are special â€”
they are treated just like normal values (numbers, strings, etc.)
That means you can:
Store them in variables
Pass them to other functions
Return them from other functions -->
//Store a function in a variable
