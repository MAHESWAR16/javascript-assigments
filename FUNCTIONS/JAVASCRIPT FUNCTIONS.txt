                                                                              JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS 


What is a function?
A function is like a small box that can do some work for you.
Example 👇
function add() {
  console.log("I am adding numbers");
}
Here —
the box name is add,
and inside the box is the work: console.log("I am adding numbers").

Step 2: How do we make the box work?
We tell JavaScript:
“Hey, open the box and do the work!”
We do that like this 👇
add();
Now it prints:
I am adding numbers

Step 3: What if we want the box to open by itself?
Let’s say you want the box to open immediately —
the moment JavaScript sees it.
You can do this 👇
(function() {
  console.log("Box opened automatically!");
})();
✅ Output:
Box opened automatically!
You didn’t say add(); anywhere.
It just ran by itself! 😄



🪄 Step 4: How does it work?

Let’s break it slowly 👇

(function()
 {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
)();

🔹 Part 1: (function() 
{ ... }
)

This makes a small box (function).

🔹 Part 2: () at the end

This tells JavaScript:

“Now open the box and run it!”

So —
✅ You make the box
✅ and open it immediately.

Step 5: Why do people do this?
Imagine your school bag. 🎒
You put your pencils and erasers inside it.
If you zip it closed — nobody can touch your pencils. ✏️
That’s what this does.
(function() 
{
  var pencil = "I am safe inside the bag";
  console.log(pencil);
}
)();

✅ Output:
I am safe inside the bag
If you try to look outside the bag 👇
console.log(pencil); // ❌
You’ll get an error —
because the pencil is inside the bag, and you can’t see it outside.
