Great — here is the EASIEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION of recursion, designed ONLY for beginners.

I will explain your exact program in the simplest way.

✅ First: Here is your program
function abc(l)
{
    console.log("l", l)
 
    while(l <= 2)
    {
        l = l + 1
        abc(l)
    }
 
    console.log('hello world')
}

abc(1)

⭐ EASY VERSION — Treat recursion like climbing stairs
Think recursion like this:
✔ When you call a function → you go one step down
✔ When the function finishes → you go one step up

Going down prints l
Coming up prints hello world

Nothing else.

⭐ SUPER SIMPLE RULE
❗ The code after the recursive call runs only when coming back.

This is the ONLY rule you need.

⭐ Now let’s walk through your program slowly (super easy)

Call:

abc(1)

🔽 GOING DOWN (recursive calls)
1️⃣ abc(1)
prints → l 1


1 <= 2
so call → abc(2)
abc(1) is now WAITING.

2️⃣ abc(2)
prints → l 2


2 <= 2
so call → abc(3)
abc(2) is now WAITING.

3️⃣ abc(3)
prints → l 3


Now 3 <= 2 ❌ (false)
so no recursion.

prints → hello world


abc(3) finishes → goes back to abc(2)

🔼 COMING UP (after recursive calls return)
BACK TO 2️⃣ abc(2)

Now abc(2)’s while-loop ends.

prints → hello world


abc(2) finishes → goes back to abc(1)

BACK TO 1️⃣ abc(1)

⚠ IMPORTANT
When we return to abc(1) → l has become 2
So while loop continues again:

l = 2 + 1 → becomes 3


Call → abc(3) again.

abc(3) prints:

l 3
hello world


Return to abc(1).

Now abc(1)’s while loop ends.

Finally:

hello world

⭐ FINAL Output (simple)
l 1
l 2
l 3
hello world
hello world
l 3
hello world
hello world

⭐ THE SIMPLEST SUMMARY
✔ Recursion = two movements

Going down → prints l

Coming up → prints hello world

✔ Code after recursive call runs when coming back
