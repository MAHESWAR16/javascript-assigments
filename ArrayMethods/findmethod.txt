var array  = [ 12, 45, 32,42,62,18,4,8,16]


 var x = array.find(function(a,b)

 {

   if(a === 1000)
 
     {
          return true 
     }
     else
     {
        return false
     }

    }
 )

 console.log(x)

 explanation :
 FIRST: WHO CALLS THIS FUNCTION?
This function is NOT called by you.

function(a, b) { ... }

👉 It is called by array.find()
So every return goes back to find(), NOT to x.
This is VERY important.

SECOND: WHAT DOES find() WANT FROM THIS FUNCTION?

find() asks only one question each time:
“Is this the element I’m looking for?”
Your function must answer:
true → YES, this is the one
false → NO, keep searching
That’s it.

THIRD: WHAT IS a?

During find():

a = current array element

b = index (you’re not using it)

So internally, this happens:

a = 12
a = 45
a = 32
a = 42
...


One by one.

FOURTH: WHAT DOES return false MEAN?
return false means:

“This element is NOT what you are looking for.”

It tells find():
👉 “No match. Go to the next element.”

That’s all.

It does NOT:

stop the program

go into x

print anything

It only talks to find().

FIFTH: STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION (IMPORTANT)

Let’s dry-run your code.

Array:
[12, 45, 32, 42, 62, 18, 4, 8, 16]

find() starts checking:
1️⃣ a = 12
12 === 1000 → false
return false


find says → ❌ not found, continue

2️⃣ a = 45
45 === 1000 → false
return false

3️⃣ a = 32

false → continue

4️⃣ a = 42

false → continue

5️⃣ a = 62

false → continue

6️⃣ a = 18

false → continue

7️⃣ a = 4

false → continue

8️⃣ a = 8

false → continue

9️⃣ a = 16

false → continue

SIXTH: WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END?

No element ever returned true.

So find() says:

“I checked everything. Nothing matched.”

So find() returns:

undefined


That value goes into x.


VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION (PLEASE READ)
return false

➡ goes to find()
➡ means “keep searching”

return true

➡ goes to find()
➡ means “stop and return this element”

x

➡ gets only the final result of find()

ONE-LINE SUMMARY (MEMORIZE THIS)

return false tells find() “this is not the element, move on”.
