What is forEach()?
forEach() is a method used only on arrays to loop through each element one by one.
It runs a function for each element in the array.
forEach says “Go to each element in this array one by one.”
forEach always needs a function.
Because forEach will call that function again and again for every item in the array.
We are passing a function as an argument in forEach().
How is that function working?
Who is calling it?
var numbers = [25, 12, 45, 32];
| Loop Round | Item (a) | Index (i) |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1          | 25       | 0         |
| 2          | 12       | 1         |
| 3          | 45       | 2         |
| 4          | 32       | 3         |
