// REMEMBER   JavaScript Rule  to call a function is   denoted as ()
// remener 
 variable decalaration  :
 var x 
 variable assigment :
 var x 
 x = 10
 variable intilization : at the time of declaration when we intialize a value to a variable that is called  variable  intilixation.
 var x = 10

what is hoisitng 
when javascrit runs the code there  are two phase 
1 loading time or compile time . memory creation phase
2  run time or execution  time . javascript runs the code LINE BY LINE , happerns after loading is finsihed . 

In loading time hositing takes place hoisitng means javascript reads the code before execution  and identify varibale declarations and function declarations and allocate a memory for them and kept in the top place , javascript does not ececute .in loading time .

what happens step by step in loading time and run time for the below code 

function foo1()
{
    console.log("hi, this is declaritve function")
}

var foo2 = function ()
           {
            console.log('edupoly')
           }
foo1()
foo2()

LOADING TIME : (Before Running)

JavaScript looks at your code and prepares memory:

      Code	                       What Happens During Loading Time	                      Stored Value
function foo1(){...}	Function Declaration → Stores full function	             foo1 = function(){ console.log(..) }
var foo2 = function(){...}      	Variable declared → No value assigned yet	           foo2 = undefined

So memory after loading:
foo1 → function(){ console.log("hi, this is declaritive function") }
foo2 → undefined

⚠️ Important:
foo1 is ready to use.
foo2 is not ready yet (because assignment has not happened).

RUN TIME : (Now Code Executes)
step1
Now JavaScript starts executing line-by-line:
foo1()
foo1 already contains function → Runs it
Output:
hi, this is declaritive function

step2 
var foo2 = function(){ console.log('edupoly') }
his line assigns the function to foo2.
Now memory becomes:
foo2 → function(){ console.log('edupoly') }

Step 3:
foo2()
Now foo2 finally has the function → Runs it
Output:
edupoly

final ouput 
hi, this is declaritive function
edupoly
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
what will happens in this code like loading time and run time 
foo1()
foo2()

function foo1()
{
    console.log("hi, this is declaritve function")
}

var foo2 = function ()
           {
            console.log('edupoly')
           }


First Stage → Loading Time (Hoisting)
JavaScript scans and prepares memory before running the code.
Code	                       What JavaScript Does During Loading Time	                      Stored Value
function foo1(){...}	  Full function is stored in memory	                    foo1 = function(){ console.log(..) }
var foo2 = function(){...}	Only variable declared, function NOT assigned yet       	foo2 = undefined

Memory after Hoisting:
foo1 → function(){ console.log("hi, this is declaritive function") }
foo2 → undefined

Second Stage → Run Time (Execution)

Now JavaScript executes line by line.
Step 1:
foo1()
foo1 already has the function → so it runs it ✅
Output:
hi, this is declaritve function

Step 2:
foo2()
But foo2 = undefined at this moment (because assignment comes later).
So we are trying to do:
undefined()
This causes an Error ❌
Output/Error:
TypeError: foo2 is not a function

Final Output of Your Code
hi, this is declaritve function
TypeError: foo2 is not a function

how js is telling foo2 is not funciton above case

How JS knows foo2 is not a function
During Loading Time (Hoisting):
var foo2 = function() { console.log('edupoly') }
Only the variable declaration happens, not the assignment.
So JavaScript stores:
foo2 → undefined
Now at Run Time, when JS executes:
foo2()
What actually happens is:
undefined()    // function call means abc() 
Which means we are trying to call undefined like a function.


JavaScript Rule
Only functions can be called with ().
But here:
foo2 is undefined  → not a function
So JavaScript throws the error:
TypeError: foo2 is not a function

exmaples:

console.log(a);
var a = 5;
console.log(a);

Explain what happens during loading time and during runtime.
Step-by-step explanation:

🔹 Loading (Creation) Phase:
The JavaScript engine scans the code before execution.
It hoists variable declarations (not assignments) to the top of their scope.
So, internally, JS treats it like this:
var a; // declared but not assigned
console.log(a);
a = 5;
console.log(a);

🔹 Runtime (Execution) Phase:
First console.log(a) → a exists but has no value yet → undefined
Then a = 5; → the value 5 is assigned to a.
Second console.log(a) → now prints 5

output 
undefined
5
